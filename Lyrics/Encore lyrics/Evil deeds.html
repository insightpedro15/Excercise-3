	<h1> Evil Deed</h1>
	<p>[Intro]
	<br>Lord, please forgive me for what I do
	<br>For I know not what I've done

	<br>[Hook]
	<br>Father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
	<br>I just never had the chance to ever meet you
<br>Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
<br>My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
<br>
<br>[Verse 1]
<br>Momma had a baby and its head popped off
<br>Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
<br>Well, Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
<br>Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
<br>Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
<br>Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
<br>But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
<br>Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
<br>'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
<br>Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
<br>My elementary, they ganged up on me and sang this song
<br>Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song
<br>It went a little something like, "Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
<br>Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn"
<br>Momma why do they keep saying this? I just don't understand, understand
<br>And by the way, where's my dad?

<br>[Hook]
<br>Father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
<br>I just never had the chance to ever meet you
<br>Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
<br>My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

<br>[Verse 2]
<br>Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
<br>Predominantly white, predominantly black, well, what about me?
<br>Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between
<br>Predominantly both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
<br>While I'm projectile vomiting; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
<br>Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like, some kind of idi-
<br>Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
<br>Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tuch mullbish
<br>"Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
<br>And his mansion, and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
<br>And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
<br>And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
<br>Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
<br>I can't imagine it, that little rich, poor, white bastard
<br>Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
<br>Man, if I only had half of it"
<br>Shit, if you only knew the half of it
<br>Haha
<br>
<br>[Hook]
<br>Father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
<br>I just never had the chance to ever meet you
<br>Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
<br>My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
<br>
<br>[Verse 3]
<br>Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
<br>Please release me from these demons
<br>I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe
<br>I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
<br>Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
<br>Now look at all the pain I caused
<br>Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
<br>What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
<br>Everything could have been so perfect
<br>But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
<br>Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
<br>I don't even know why they feel like they know me, 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
<br>And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
<br>Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
<br>Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go
<br>Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
<br>But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
<br>Where's the switch I could just turn off and on? This ain't what I chose to be
<br>So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
<br>'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone
<br>
<br>[Hook]
<br>Father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
<br>I just never had the chance to ever meet you
<br>Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
<br>My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
<br>I said, father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
<br>I just never had the chance to ever meet you
<br>Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
<br>My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
<br>(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)
<br>
