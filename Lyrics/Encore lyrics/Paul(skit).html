	<p>
	Hey Em, it's Paul, uh, listen, I just got a call from the label
And you're probably not gonna be surprised but, um
Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the "Just Lose It" video
And, um, I mean he's pissed, so I don't know what he's gonna do
But we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this
Um, oh yeah, anyway, somebody told me that, um
They heard a rumor that you got a new gun
Um, I know it's probably not true
But I just need to talk to you about that
So, um, gimme a call
